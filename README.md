# Keyboard_Exercise
Keyboard Exercise in React

Used React to build a simple in-browser keyboard, with CSS animations, onClick events for each key, and key input.

The Black Keys are fixed to be one third of the width of the other keys (see picture below).

Next Steps include adding multiple notes in the text input, and allowing the upper part of each white key to register as pressed.
